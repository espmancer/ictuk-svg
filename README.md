Copy this code into a SVG editor/visualizer and use the guide at the bottom to draw what you'd like. I personally like to use [this](https://editsvgcode.com/) one. The code has every glyph provided, numbers 1-50, and will have phrases and words added as I work on it.
I may also make a glyph writing program that's a little more user friendly in the future.
